*timestamp.vim*  Plugin for automated time stamping

Description:~

When a file is written, and the filename matches |timestamp_automask|, this
plugin will search the first and last |timestamp_modelines| lines of your
file. If it finds the regexp |timestamp_regexp| then it will replace it with a
timestamp. The timestamp is computed by first doing a |token_substitution| on
|timestamp_rep| and passing the result to |strftime()|. 

The plugin tries to stay out of your way, and make the change as transparent
as possible. All your history (search, command, etc) and jumplists are
unaltered, except the undo history (which contains an additional change).

All the default variables and actions can be changed by buffer / global vim
variables. See |timestamp_examples| for two simple examples.

The plugin and its documentation file can be installed as described under
|add-global-plugin| and |add-local-help|. Do not forget to run |:helptags|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options and Specifications:~
							
1. Timestamp Regexp format:				*timestamp_regexp*

If the regexp |timestamp_regexp| is found in the first and last
|timestamp_modelines| lines of your file it is replaced by a timestamp (see
|timestamp_rep|).

Default: '\v\C%(<Last %([cC]hanged?|[Mm]odified):\s+)@<=\a{3} \d{2} \a{3} \d{4} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2} [AP]M \a+|TIMESTAMP'
		
To change this value, either set g:timestamp_regexp in your {.vimrc} or set
b:timestamp_regexp for the buffer in question. NOTE: This global variable must
be set before the plugin is loaded. HOWEVER the buffer local variable can be
set at any time.

NOTE: Forward slashes are automatically escaped.

The default value will EITHER match 'TIMESTAMP' or a time (in the format of
strftime("%c")) FOLLOWED by a 'Last changed:' or 'Last modified:'. For
instance, if you create a new file and want to stamp it with a creation date
and a last modified date, make the first few lines: >

    Created:		TIMESTAMP
    Last Modified:	TIMESTAMP

When you first write the file, these lines will change to: >

    Created:		Thu 26 Feb 2004 03:15:54 PM CST
    Last Modified:	Thu 26 Feb 2004 03:16:02 PM CST

On subsequent writes of the file, the first line will remain unchanged and the
second will be stamped with the time of writing.

NOTE: If you find that on subsequent writes of the file, the second line is
also unchanged, it is probably because the time returned by strftime is NOT is
the format above. [Look closely and see if there is a leading 0 or timezone
missing]. If you are using version 1.11 and higher and still have this
problem, please report it to me. As a temporary fix, you can put the line >

    let timestamp_regexp = '\v\C%(<Last %([cC]hanged?|[Mm]odified):\s+)@<=.*$'

in your .vimrc. This however has the disadvantage of eating all the text after
the colon in any timestamp line.

NOTE: The first line (begining with "Created:") is optional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Timestamp Replacement format:			*timestamp_rep*

The timestamp is computed by first doing a |token_substitution| on
|timestamp_rep| and passing the result to |strftime()|.

Default: '%a %d %b %Y %I:%M:%S %p %Z'
    [On Linux systems this is equivalent to the prefferd date and time
    representation for the current locale.]

To change this value, either set g:timestamp_rep in your {.vimrc} or set
b:timestamp_rep for the buffer in question. NOTE: This global variable must be
set before the plugin is loaded. HOWEVER the buffer local variable can be set
at any time.

NOTE: Forward slashes are automatically escaped.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Token Substitution:					*token_substitution*

Before being passed to |strftime()|, |timestamp_rep| undergoes the following
substitutions:

    Token	Substitution~
    #f		|timestamp_filename|
    #h		|timestamp_hostname|
    #H		|timestamp_Hostname|
    #u		|timestamp_username|
    #i		|timestamp_userid|

							*timestamp_filename*
    The "#f" token is replaced by the filename of the current buffer (without
    leading path components).

							*timestamp_hostname*
    The #h token is replaced by the hostname of the current vim process. 
   
    The user can specify the desired value with the global variable
    g:timestamp_hostname. If that variable does not exist, the value of the
    $HOSTNAME environment variable will be used. If there is no $HOSTNAME, the
    output of the hostname() function is used. However, only the last word
    returned by that function is preserved. The platform type of qualifier
    (e.g. PC) is not kept. NOTE: This global variable must be set before the
    plugin is loaded.

							*timestamp_Hostname*
    The #H token is also replaced by the hostname. However, the platform
    qualifier is not removed.

							*timestamp_username*
    The #u token will be replaced by the user name. This will be obtained from
    the g:timestamp_username variable if it exists. Otherwise, it is
    initialised from the $USERNAME environment variable. NOTE: This global
    variable must be set before the plugin is loaded.

							*timestamp_userid*
    The #i token will be replaced by the userid. This will be obtained from
    the g:timestamp_userid variable if it exists. Otherwise, it is initialised
    from the $LOGNAME environment variable. NOTE: This global variable must be
    set before the plugin is loaded.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
4. Timestamp Auto command Mask				*timestamp_automask*

By default, the plugin installs an "autocommand BufWrite" for all files. So it
uses '*' as {pat} (see |:autocmd|). The user can overrule this behaviour by
defining g:timestamp_automask with the desired value, e.g.: >

    :let g:timestamp_automask = "*.html"

to limit timestamping to html files. NOTE: This global variable has to be set
BEFORE the plugin is loaded.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. timestamp_modelines					*timestamp_modelines*

The number of lines searched for the |timestamp_regexp| is controlled by the
|timestamp_modelines| variable. By default this will be equal to the
'modelines' option. To specify a different value, set the global vim variable
'g:timestamp_modelines'. NOTE: This global variable has to be set BEFORE the
plugin is loaded.

If this is set to to '%' all lines in the file will be searched for the regexp
|timestamp_regexp|. NOTE: This may be more than you want.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Examples:						*timestamp_examples*

  1. No case matching, short format timestamps: >

	let g:timestamp_regexp = '\v\c%(last %(changed?|modified):\s+)@<=\d{4} \a{3} \d{2}'
	let g:timestamp_rep = '%Y %b %d'

<    Result: >
	" Last change: 2004 Feb 26

< 2. Match case, with filename, username and hostname in html comments: >

	let g:timestamp_automask = '*.html'
	let g:timestamp_regexp = '\v\C%(\<!-- Timestamp:\s+)@<=.{-}%(\s*--\>)@='
	let g:timestamp_rep = '%a %d/%m/%Y %r #u@#h:#f'

<    Result: >
	<!-- Timestamp: Thu 26/02/2004 05:49:33 PM gautam@math:timestamp.txt -->
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Change History					*timestamp_history*

Version 1.13:~
  Removed unwanted code for preserving cursor location. With use of setline
  and getline this is no longer necessary. A bug caused timestamp.vim to make
  changes in all lines in the |timestamp_modelines| range. Corrected the code
  so that now changes are made only when there is a timestamp in a particular
  line. This makes undoing changes a lot easier.

Version 1.12:~
  Some Micro$oft machines don't support the timezone ('%Z'). Made the timezone
  optional in the default settings. The script (with default settings) should
  now work on both Linux / Window$ machines. Thanks to Krall Ed-P27726 for
  testing this.

Version 1.11:~
  Minor bug fix. The format of strftime("%c") is not standard among all
  systems / locales. Changed the default value of "timestamp_rep" from "%c" to
  the full expanded version. This should be more robust.

Version 1.1:~
  Does not modify any marks or the search history list. Tries to make
  timestamping as "transparent" as possible.

Version 1.0:~
  Original fork of "timstamp.vim". See |timestamp_differences| for a list of
  differences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Differences From Timstamp:				*timestamp_differences*

This script is based on "timstamp.vim" originally written by Guido Van Hoecke
<Guido@VanHoecke.org>. There are many differences:

  1. Note the extra E in the name (timEstamp).

  2. Some bug fixes.

  3. Splits the pattern and replacement into two separate variables.

  4. Allows buffer local variables to replace the timestamp controls.

  5. Removed support for multiple timestamps (I thought this was wasteful,
     besides allowing buffer local variables to control timestamps makes this
     unnecessary. Timestamps for particular filetypes can be set by buffer
     local variables in filetype plugins)

  6. timstamp_* variables are no longer present. Use |timestamp_regexp| for
     the search pattern, and |timestamp_rep| for the replacement.
     |timestamp_rep| is substituted for filenames and then passed to
     |strftime()|.

  7. Removed the language setting. |strftime()| should provide this in your
     favourite language (provided your locale is set correctly)

  8. By default the timestamp regexps will NOT match everything after a
     "Last changed" or "Last modified". It will match exactly a time after
     each of those expressions! Hence a line like >

     		<i>Last changed: Tue 17 Feb 2004 04:18:40 PM CST</i>

<    will get replaced with >

     		<i>Last changed: Wed 18 Feb 2004 05:14:16 PM CST</i>

<    Note that the final </i> is left unchanged!

  9. To create a new timestamp in a file, put a line of the form
  
  		Last changed: TIMESTAMP (other optional stuff)

     in your file. The TIMESTAMP will get replaced with a timestamp. This
     only works with the default regexp. If you change that you're on your
     own

 10. To check the entire file, set timestamp_modelines to '%' (instead of the
     unintuitive '$' as before)
